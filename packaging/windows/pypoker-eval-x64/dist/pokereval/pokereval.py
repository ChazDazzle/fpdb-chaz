knowing if a given card is taken from the board or not is significant
(such as Omaha but not Holdem).

A list is returned. The first element is the numerical value
of the hand (better hands have higher values if "side" is "hi" and
lower values if "side" is "low"). The second element is a list whose
first element is the strength of the hand among the following:

Nothing (only if "side" equals "low")
NoPair
TwoPair
Trips
Straight
Flush
FlHouse
Quads
StFlush

The last five elements are numbers describing the best hand properly
sorted (for instance the ace is at the end for no pair if "side" is low or
at the beginning if "side" high).

at index 0 won the high side of the hand and pocket cards at index 1
won the low side.

See the"poker_eval" method for a detailed
explanation of the semantics of the arguments.

If the keyword argument "fill_pockets" is set, pocket cards
can contain a placeholder (i.e. 255 or __) that will be be
used as specified in the "poker_eval" method documentation.

If the keyword argument "fill_pockets" is not set, pocket cards
that contain at least one placeholder (i.e. 255 or __) are
ignored completly. For instance if winners is called as follows
o.winners(game = 'holdem', pockets = [ [ '__', 'As' ], [ 'Ks', 'Kd'] ])
it is strictly equivalent as calling
o.winners(game = 'holdem', pockets = [ [ 'Ks', 'Kd'] ]).

Provided with a description of a poker game, return the outcome (if at showdown) or
the expected value of each hand. The poker game description is provided as a set
of keyword arguments with the following meaning:

game      : the variant (holdem, holdem8, omaha, omaha8, 7stud, 7stud8, razz,
            5draw, 5draw8, 5drawnsq, lowball, lowball27). 
            Mandatory, no default.
                    
pockets   : list of pocket cards for each player still in game. Each member
            of the list is a list of cards. The position of the pocket cards
            in the list is meaningfull for the value returned will refer to
            this position when stating which player wins, tie or loose.
            Example: [ ["tc", "ac"],  ["3h", "ah"],  ["8c", "6h"]]
            Cards do not have to be real cards like "tc" or "4s". They may also be a 
            placeholder, denoted by "__" or 255. When using placeholders, the 
            keyword argument "iterations" may be specified to use Monte Carlo instead of
            exhaustive exploration of all the possible combinations.
            Example2: [ ["tc", "__"],  [255, "ah"],  ["8c", "6h"]]

            Mandatory, no default.

board     : list of community cards, for games where this is meaningfull. If
            specified when irrelevant, the return value cannot be predicted.
            Default: []

dead      : list of dead cards. These cards won't be accounted for when exloring
            the possible hands.
            Default: []

iterations: the maximum number of iterations when exploring the
            possible outcome of a given hand. Roughly speaking, each
            iteration means to distribute cards that are missing (for
            which there are place holders in the board or pockets
            keywords arguments, i.e. 255 or __). If the number of
            iterations is not specified and there are place holders,
            the return value cannot be predicted.
            Default: +infinite (i.e. exhaustive exploration)

Example: object.poker_eval(game = "holdem",
                           pockets = [ ["tc", "ac"],  ["3h", "ah"],  ["8c", "6h"]],

                           board = ["7h", "3s", "2c"])

The return value is a map of two entries:
'info' contains three integers:
 - the number of samples (which must be equal to the number of iterations given
   in argument).
 - 1 if the game has a low side, 0 otherwise
 - 1 if the game has a high side, 0 otherwise
'eval' is a list of as many maps as there are pocket cards, each
made of the following entries:
 'scoop': the number of time these pocket cards scoop
 'winhi': the number of time these pocket cards win the high side
 'losehi': the number of time these pocket cards lose the high side
 'tiehi': the number of time these pocket cards tie for the high side
 'winlo': the number of time these pocket cards win the low side
 'loselo': the number of time these pocket cards lose the low side
 'tielo': the number of time these pocket cards tie for the low side
 'ev': the EV of these pocket cards as an int in the range [0,1000] with
       1000 being the best.

It should be clear that if there is only one sample (i.e. because all the
cards are known which is the situation that occurs at showdown) the details
provided by the 'eval' entry is mostly irrelevant and the caller might
prefer to call the winners method instead.
